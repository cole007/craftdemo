    			<p><strong>Eric Arthur Blair</strong> (25 June 1903 – 21 January 1950), better known by the pen name <strong>George Orwell</strong>, was an English novelist, essayist, journalist, and critic. His work is marked by lucid prose, awareness of social injustice, opposition to totalitarianism, and outspoken support of democratic socialism.</p>

    			<p>Orwell wrote literary criticism, poetry, fiction, and polemical journalism. He is best known for the allegorical novella <em>Animal Farm</em> (1945) and the dystopian novel <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em> (1949). His non-fiction works, including <em>The Road to Wigan Pier</em> (1937), documenting his experience of working class life in the north of England, and <em>Homage to Catalonia</em> (1938), an account of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage_to_Catalonia">experiences</a> in the Spanish Civil War, are widely acclaimed, as are his essays on politics, literature, language, and culture. In 2008, <em>The Times</em> ranked him second on a list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945".</p>

    			<p>Orwell's work continues to influence popular and political culture, and the term <em>Orwellian</em> – descriptive of totalitarian or authoritarian social practices – has entered the language together with many of his neologisms, including <em>cold war</em>, <em>Big Brother</em>, <em>Thought Police</em>, <em>Room 101</em>, <em>memory hole</em>, <em>newspeak</em>, <em>doublethink</em>, and <em>thoughtcrime</em>.</p>
